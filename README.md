# Swan-Lake
A didatic and visual way to understand P-Cygni profiles and explore how different wind properties can shape these elegant spectral line profiles.

The project is written in Julia and should be visualized using Pluto Notebooks. Therefore, this mini-project is a way for me to also learn more about this elegant programming language!

In case you are wondering, the name Swan Lake is beause "Cygni" means "swan" in Latin and the ballet Swan Lake was written by **P**yotr Tchaikovski. P-Cygni profiles are named as such because they were first noticed in the spectrum of the star P Cygni, which is located in the Cygnus (Swan) constellation! However many stars which have strong radiative driven winds show this kind of profiles in their spectra.
